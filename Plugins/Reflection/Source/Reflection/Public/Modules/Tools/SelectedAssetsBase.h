/* Base for the Cloud tools, which all do the same thing: take what the user selected in the
 * Content Browser, ask the Cloud for each asset's exports, and apply them.
 *
 * Execute returns as soon as it has read the selection. The run then walks the selection one
 * asset at a time off the back of each Cloud response, so the editor stays usable throughout and
 * a tool that can't reach the Cloud costs a request timeout instead of a frozen editor.
 *
 * Because a run outlives the call that started it, a tool instance has to outlive its requests
 * and can only have one run in flight; the registry keeps a single instance of each tool.
 *
 * A tool is added to the Cloud dropdown by REGISTER_TOOL below its declaration, and describes
 * itself there through GetDisplayName, GetTooltip and GetIcon. */
