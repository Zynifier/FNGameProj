 * Cloud serves a texture one of two ways. An encoded image is the cheap path: it goes through
 * UTextureFactory, which handles mips and compression on its own. It is also eight bit and two
 * dimensional, so anything carrying more depth or precision than that has to ask for the raw
 * bytes of the first mip instead and be rebuilt by hand. */
