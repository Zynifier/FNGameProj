/* Builds a graph back out of the bytecode a function was cooked as.
 *
 * The bytecode is what the compiler made of a graph, and most of it maps straight back. A call is a
 * node. A constant is a value sat on a pin. The locals a function declares are mostly not variables
 * at all: the compiler makes one for every output pin it has to hold onto, names it after the node
 * and the pin it came from, and reading those names back is what says which pin fed which.
 *
 * What it cannot read back is anything the compiler invented and did not name, so control flow is
 * handled apart from this: the push and pop pairs that carry loops and branches are the shape of a
 * macro after expansion rather than anything a single node stands for. */
