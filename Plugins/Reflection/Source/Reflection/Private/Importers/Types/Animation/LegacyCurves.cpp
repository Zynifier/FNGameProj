/* An animation written for the newer rig, said in the names an older head drives.
 *
 * The mapping is written one way round: each of the newer rig's controls is an expression over the
 * older head's curves. Read forward that turns an older animation into a newer one, and a pose
 * asset is built that way round too, one pose per older curve.
 *
 * An animation out of the game is already the newer rig's, so it has to be read the other way. Each
 * control the animation drives is one statement about the curves underneath it this much of this
 * curve plus that much of that one came to the number you can see and an emote drives far more
 * controls than there are curves beneath them. Forty one statements about thirty eight unknowns is
 * not a puzzle with a missing piece; it is one with more pieces than it needs, and the curves that
 * best account for the whole set at once are what comes out.
 *
 * Solved a frame at a time, holding every curve at or above zero because a face curve that went
 * negative would drive the rig somewhere it was never authored to go.
 *
 * It is a fit rather than a recovery, and it says so: the emote was authored on the newer rig
 * directly, so it moves controls in combinations no older curve can produce, and those parts have
 * nowhere to land. What comes back is the closest an older head can stand. */
