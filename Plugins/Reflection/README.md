Reflection takes assets from [FModel](https://github.com/4sval/FModel), and puts them straight in your project: materials, data tables, physics assets, and more.

### Uses
* Importing **materials**, data assets, and data tables — [see more](#asset-types)
* Porting **physics assets** for skeletal meshes
* Porting **sound effects** to Unreal Engine
* Automating asset porting workflows

This project aims to streamline the porting and modding experience, making it easier to bring game assets into Unreal Engine.

<a name="asset-types"></a>
## Asset Types
If an asset type isn't listed below, **it's not currently supported by the plugin**.

|  | Asset Types |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🟢 **Curve** | CurveFloat, CurveVector, CurveLinearColor, CurveLinearColorAtlas |
| 🟣 **Data** | DataAsset, SlateBrushAsset, SlateWidgetStyleAsset, LandscapeLayerInfoObject, HLODProxy, AnimBoneCompressionSettings, AnimCurveCompressionSettings, UserDefinedEnum, UserDefinedStruct |
| 🔵 **Table** | CurveTable, DataTable, MirrorDataTable, StringTable |
| 🟠 **Material** | Material, MaterialFunction, MaterialInstanceConstant, MaterialParameterCollection, SubsurfaceProfile |
| 🟧 **Texture** | Texture2D, TextureCube, Texture2DArray, VolumeTexture, TextureRenderTarget2D, TextureLightProfile, RuntimeVirtualTexture, PaperSprite. Pixels are fetched by a [Cloud Server](#cloud)! |
| 🟡 **Sound** | SoundCue and most other sound classes are supported. SoundWave is fetched by a [Cloud Server](#cloud)! |
| 🔴 **Animation** | PoseAsset, Skeleton, SkeletalMeshLODSettings, BlendSpace, BlendSpace1D, AimOffsetBlendSpace, AimOffsetBlendSpace1D |
| ⚪ **Physics** | PhysicsAsset, PhysicalMaterial |
| 🟤 **Sequencer** | CameraAnim, ForceFeedbackEffect |
| ✨ **Effects** | ParticleSystem, VectorFieldStatic. Vector data is fetched by a [Cloud Server](#cloud)! |
| 🟩 **Landscape** | LandscapeGrassType, FoliageType_InstancedStaticMesh, FoliageType_Actor |
| 🔤 **UI** | Font |

#### The following asset types add onto a pre-existing asset
|  | Asset Types |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **🔴 Animation** | AnimSequence, AnimMontage **(Animation Curves)** |
| **🔵 Mesh** | StaticMesh **(Collision)**, SkeletalMesh **(Sockets, Clothing)** |
| **🔤 UI** | FontFace **(Font Properties)**, WidgetBlueprint **(Widget Animations)** |

These are reached from **Cloud Tools** with the asset selected in your content browser, and need a [Cloud Server](#cloud).

#### Partial Blueprint Importing (Experimental)
If the parent class exists, it'll import the components and defaults of the blueprint (Blueprints, Widget Blueprints, and Animation Blueprints). Enable **Enable Experiments** in Plugin Settings to use it.

<a name="material-data-prerequisites"></a>
#### 🟠 Material Data Prerequisites
Unreal Engine games made below 4.12 (a guess) will have material data. *Games made above that version will most definitely not have any material data*, and therefore the actual data will be stripped and cannot be imported. **Unless you are using a User Generated Content editor**, then it's possible material data will be there.

#### 🟣 C++ Classes Prerequisites
If your game uses custom C++ classes or structures, **you need to define them**.

See [Unreal Engine Modding Projects](https://github.com/Buckminsterfullerene02/UE-Modding-Tools?tab=readme-ov-file#game-specific-template-projects) for game-specific template projects.

## Installation
[<img align="left" width="150" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8e4f9c9-1268-4aee-ab1a-dabee31b3069?raw=true">](https://fmodel.app)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you haven't already, **install [FModel](https://fmodel.app) and set it up correctly, then proceed with the setup**.

We strongly recommend using the latest **commit** of Reflection to ensure compatibility with recent Unreal updates and access to the newest features.

Follow these steps to install **Reflection**:

1. **Download Reflection:**   
   There are two ways you can download Reflection. You can either stay up-to-date with the latest development changes (recommended if you want the newest features and fixes, but may occasionally require manual fixing), or download stable releases.

   1. **Up-to-date (Git Submodule)**   
      Open a terminal in your Unreal project root (where your `.uproject` file is located), then run:

      ```sh
      git submodule add https://github.com/JsonAsAsset/Reflection.git Plugins/Reflection
      git submodule update --init --recursive
      ```

   2. **Stable Releases (Manual Download)**   
      Go to the [Releases page](/../../releases) for the plugin.
      Download the **Source code (zip)**, extract it into your project's `Plugins` folder (create it if it doesn't exist), so the final path looks like:

      ```
      Project/Plugins/Reflection/
      ```
3. **Compile:**   
   Follow [**this tutorial**](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/qz93/unreal-engine-building-plugins) to build the plugin for your Unreal Engine version.
4. **Launch Your Project:**   
   Open your Unreal Engine project.

<details>
  <summary>Compile step failing on <b>Unreal Engine 4</b>? (<b>UnrealBuildTool.exe</b> not found)</summary>
  <br>

Some UE4 builds may fail to locate **UnrealBuildTool.exe** due to missing platform path definitions. You can fix this by manually adding a `PlatformPaths` entry to `BaseEngine.ini`.

#### Steps

1. Go to your Unreal Engine install directory:
   ```
   UE_[VERSION]/Engine/Config/
   ```
2. Open:
   ```
   BaseEngine.ini
   ```
3. Scroll to the very bottom of the file and add:
   ```ini
   [PlatformPaths]
   UnrealBuildTool=Engine/Binaries/DotNet/UnrealBuildTool.exe
   ```
4. Save the file.

<a name="cloud"></a>
### Cloud ☁️
[Set up a Cloud instance](https://github.com/JsonAsAsset/Core/releases) and start it.

Once running, Reflection **fetches references automatically** instead of asking you for each one, and a **Cloud Tools** menu lets you reflect extra data (collision, animation curves, sockets, fonts, and more) onto assets you've already imported.

-----------------

<a name="workflow"></a>
## Workflow
Reflection works off **asset paths**, and a [Cloud](#cloud) instance fetches the exports behind them. Nothing has to be saved out of FModel first.

1. **Start your Cloud instance.** The button next to Reflection in the content browser toolbar reads `On` once it's up.

2. **Copy the path of an asset.** Either form works, so a reference copied straight out of FModel is fine:
   ```
   /Game/Asset.uasset
   ```
3. **Press the Reflection button** on your content browser toolbar. A dialog opens, and anything path-like already on your clipboard is queued for you.

4. **Queue as many as you want.** Type or paste a path and press `Enter` (or `Add`), several pasted at once queue one per line. `X` takes one back out.

5. **Press Reflect.** Every reference each asset needs is fetched as it goes, so you only ever name the one you actually want.

Anything that couldn't be rebuilt is collected into a **Errors** window at the end.

#### Other ways in

|---|---|
| **A whole folder of the game files** | **Folder**, under the Reflection dropdown. Reflects everything under a game path, not one in your project. |
