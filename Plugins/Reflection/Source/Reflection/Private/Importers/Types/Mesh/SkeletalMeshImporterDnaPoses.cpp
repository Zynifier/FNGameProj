/* A MetaHuman face for an engine that cannot read one.
 *
 * RigLogic is what turns a head's controls into joints, and it ships with Unreal Engine 5. Older
 * engines have nothing that reads a DNA at all, so the face is flattened into a pose asset instead:
 * one pose per control, holding the joints that control moves. An animation graph drives those
 * poses off the same curves the rig would have read, and the head moves without the rig.
 *
 * The numbers come from the Cloud already worked out, which is what makes this possible here: the
 * arithmetic that needs RigLogic happens where RigLogic is, and what arrives is a list of joints. */
