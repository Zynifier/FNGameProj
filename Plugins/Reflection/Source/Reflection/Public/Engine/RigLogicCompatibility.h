 *
 * From 5.6 the engine puts a RigLogicDNAReader between the DNA and RigLogic to convert into UE's
 * axes as it reads, and the node then writes joints without flipping anything itself. Building
 * RigLogic straight off the DNA instead leaves its output a DNA-space pose that nothing downstream
 * expects, which reads as a skeleton with every rotation and every sideways offset inverted.
 *
 * Older engines have no such wrapper: the DNA goes in as it is and the node does the axes on the
 * way out, so there the plain reader is already the right one.
 *
 * The wrapper only has to survive the construction RigLogic copies everything it needs out of
 * the reader there and never looks at it again so it is safe to let it go at the return. */
